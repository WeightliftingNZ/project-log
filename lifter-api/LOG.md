# lifter-api log

## Sunday 29 May 2022

First meeting between Shivan and Diogo to discuss the project details.

- Focus on building an API to connect to [owlcms software](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4).
- Shivan was concerned about historical records, but this can be pushed lower down the priority since we want to focus on new competitions.
- Diogo to talk to Gabi.
